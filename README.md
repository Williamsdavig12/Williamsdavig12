In 2020 I lost over 6 BTC. Well, the first thing I did was to google my issue, which I did. During my search process, I ran into various recovery companies, friends and colleagues who discouraged me, they said it was all a scam and I wouldn’t be able to recover my money back. I eventually contacted Saclux Comptech Specialst among the recovery companies I ran into during my Google search process and they asked a few questions which I answered and he proceeded to work on my problem, the good news is that my lost bitcoin was returned to my wallet. These are their contact in case you have a similar case like mine.
